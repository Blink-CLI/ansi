# Ansi Helper

This helper provides a class (`BlinkCLI\Ansi\Ansi`) which stores terminal output sequences for Ansi and includes a minimal Ansi string builder (`BlinkCLI\Ansi\AnsiString`) to easily build an Ansi escape sequence. The best way to start interacting with this helper is to poke around in both of those classes.
